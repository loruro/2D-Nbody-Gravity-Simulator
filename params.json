Calculations are performed using [Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method) or [Runge-Kutta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods) method (choice in option menu). You can also specify time step of simulation.  \r\nObjects can have different masses and sizes. They merge with each other on collision.\r\n\r\nTrails behind objects and antialiasing can be switched on in option menu.  \r\n\r\nThere are also two prepared presets:\r\n* The Solar System\r\n* [Protostar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protostar) with [protoplanetary disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoplanetary_disk)\r\n\r\nTested on Ubuntu Linux and Windows.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://loruro.github.io/\"><sub>⟵ Back</sub></a>",
